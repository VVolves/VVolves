- 👋 Hi, I’m @VVolves
- 👀 I’m interested in Cardano and NFT projects. I have always been interested in coding and find it super fun - I have been learning HTML, CSS and some Java over the last 6 months.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to launch, run, and maintain my own Cardano Node - I want to learn how to start my own stakepool :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NFT projects
- 📫 How to reach me on wolves.cardano@gmail.com
